# RESTAPI-NODEJS-HELMET
In this sample application, we're using the Express.js framework for handling HTTP requests. Here are some of the key features and practices that make this application secure and scalable:

Security Measures:
The helmet middleware is used to set various HTTP headers that enhance security.
body-parser middleware is used to parse JSON payloads in requests.
cors middleware is used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
express-rate-limit middleware is used to implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and DoS attacks.
